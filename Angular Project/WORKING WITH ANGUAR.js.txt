  a)  /src
           i) index.html -> top level HTML template of app.
          ii) style.css -> the top level style sheet.
         iii) main.ts -> is the file in which app starts running
          iv) favicon.ico -> icon of angular
 b) /app
        i) app.component.ts -> source file describing 'app-root'
       ii) app.component.css -> stylesheet description of the component
